# iCrew Community
Welcome to the official public community page for iCrew!

This community repository doesn't contain code, but serves as a place for community information and issue-tracking to assist with the development of the iCrew Rowing team management platform.

Below you will find information about using our public issue tracker to report or diagnose issues, as well as information on how to join the testing program for pre-release versions of the iCrew mobile apps for iOS and Android.


## Public Issue Tracker
This can be found at the "issues" tab above and lists current known issues with iCrew, especially the mobile apps.
If you are looking to contribute additional information that can help an existing issue get resolves, or even report a new issue that you have found, this is the place!

<!-- Discussion tab - coming soon -->
## App Testing
Want to help test upcoming versions of the iCrew apps before they are released to everyone? Check out the [Public Testing Program wikipage](https://github.com/iCrewRowing/community/wiki/Public-Testing-Program) to learn more!
